{"name":"rwordnet","body":"# A pure Ruby interface to WordNet #\r\n\r\nThis library implements a pure Ruby interface to the WordNet lexical/semantic\r\ndatabase. Unlike existing ruby bindings, this one doesn't require you to convert \r\nthe original WordNet database into a new database format; instead it can work directly\r\non the database that comes with WordNet.\r\n\r\nIf you're doing something data-intensive you will achieve much better performance\r\nwith Michael Granger's [Ruby-WordNet](http://www.deveiate.org/projects/Ruby-WordNet/), \r\nsince it converts the WordNet database into a BerkelyDB file for quicker access. In \r\nwriting rwordnet, I've focused more on usability and ease of installation ( *gem install \r\nrwordnet* ) at the expense of some performance. Use at your own risk, etc.\r\n\r\n## Installation ##\r\n\r\nOne of the chief benefits of rwordnet over Ruby-WordNet is how easy it is to install:\r\n\r\n    gem install rwordnet\r\n    \r\nThat's it! rwordnet comes bundled with the WordNet database which it uses by default, \r\nso there's absolutely nothing else to download, install, or configure.\r\nOf course, if you want to use your own WordNet installation, that's easy too -- just \r\nset the path to WordNet's database files before using the library (see examples below).\r\n\r\n## Usage ##\r\n\r\nThe other benefit of rwordnet over Ruby-WordNet is that it's so much easier (IMHO) to\r\nuse. \r\n\r\nAs a quick example, consider finding all of the noun glosses for a given word:\r\n\r\n    require 'rubygems'\r\n    require 'wordnet'\r\n    \r\n    index = WordNet::NounIndex.instance\r\n    lemma = index.find(\"fruit\")\r\n    lemma.synsets.each { |synset| puts synset.gloss }\r\n\r\n...or all of the glosses, period:\r\n\r\n    lemmas = WordNet::WordNetDB.find(\"fruit\")\r\n    synsets = lemmas.map { |lemma| lemma.synsets }\r\n    words = synsets.flatten\r\n    words.each { |word| puts word.gloss }\r\n\r\nHave your own WordNet database that you've marked up with extra attributes and whatnot?\r\nNo problem:\r\n\r\n    require 'rubygems'\r\n    require 'wordnet'\r\n    \r\n    include WordNet\r\n    WordNetDB.path = \"/path/to/WordNet-3.0\"\r\n    lemmas = WordNetDB.find(\"fruit\")\r\n    ...\r\n","tagline":"A pure Ruby interface to the WordNet database","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
